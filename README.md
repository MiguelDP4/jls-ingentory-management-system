# Inventory Management System

This is a coding interview assessment created for JSL Trading Co. It's an inventory management system. The data in the application was provided by the interviewer.

## Built With

Ruby on Rails

## How To Deploy

- Make sure your system has a database user with name 'railsdb'. The password should be saved in an environment variable called 'RAILSDB_DATABASE_PASSWORD'.

- Create the database using the following command:

```
$ rails db:create db:migrate db:seed
```
You need to seed the database if you want to have the database information. There's a .csv file in the repository, used to generate de data.

- When the user clicks on a core product, a detail page is rendered.
- From the detail page, the user can read the different locations where the product is stored, if any.
- If the user is logged in, they can modify the quantity of product stored in a specific location.
- Error is shown if the user tries remove more items than there are in the location. No negative numbers are permitted.
- The user can filter products in the product page by typing the internal name (or part of it) in the search bar and clicking on the search button.
